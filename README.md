BookApp

Basic book database.

1) You can add books along with their respective images if available.

2) You can add books that you'd like to buy.

3) You can also view your wishlist once you've submitted the information.

4) You can search for users by their username.

5) You can also delete users by searching for their username.

Instructions to run the App:

You need to have the Angular Cli and Node running on your device.

Install Node by visiting https://nodejs.org/en/ , Node comes with NPM which stands for Node Package Manager and then use NPM to install the Angular Cli like so npm install -g @angular/cli . 

To run the application, navigate inside the root folder or click and drag the folder into a terminal, whilst inside the root folder and inside a terminal simply type in npm run Client and then within another instance of the terminal type in npm run Server.

OR

You could follow the instructions below.

The front end files are found within this path Client/Views/src, once within the src folder in your terminal type in ng serve --o to launch it on your browser.

The back end files are found within this path Server/ and once in there using another terminal instance type in node server or if you have nodemon you can type in nodemon server to run the server. Nodemon is a tool which reloads files after every change has been saved.

I'm thinking about deploying it soon.

Enjoy.
