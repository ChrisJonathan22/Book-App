Instruction to run the App:

You need to have the Angular Cli and Node running on your device.

The front end files are found within this path Client/Views/src, once within the src folder in your terminal type in ng serve --o to launch it on your browser.

The back end files are found within this path Server/ and once in there using another terminal instance type in node server or if you have nodemon you can type in nodemon server to run the server. Nodemon is a tool which reloads files after every change has been saved.


I will make it so that it's possible to run both servers from the root folder soon.
